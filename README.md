# HackerRank challenges and tests

1. Interesting `Bitwise operators` challenge in C language.

2. Nubank code challenge in Python.

   - Submitted example --> passed corner tests, but exceeded execution time limit.  
- Revised sliced example --> better results, but not enough 
   - Recursion implementation --> seemed promising, but deceived.
- Time efficiency optimized example --> it works with an in place list, avoiding copying. The best result for optimized time when list increased substantially.
