# HackerRank challenges and tests

1. Interesting `Bitwise operators` challenge in C language.

2. NUbank code challenge in `Python`.

   - Submitted example --> passed corner tests, but exceeded execution time limit.
   - Revised sliced example --> better results, but not enough 
   - Recursion implementation --> seemed promising, but deceived.
   - Time efficiency optimized example --> it works with an in place list, avoiding copying. The best result for optimized time when list increased substantially.  

3. XP data analytics coding test. Python part.
    - Regex subgrouping application. Given string lines as input, extract hostname.
